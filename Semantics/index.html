        A semantic element describes the meaning of the element to the browser but also to the developer.

        The <div> and <span> are elements that have no meaning, they tell nothing about the content. 

        Elements like <form>, <table>, <article> literally tell what the content will be. A tag like <article> has the same properties as a <div> it just has more context about the content.
